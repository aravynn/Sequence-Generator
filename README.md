# Sequence Generator
 Iterated sequence for on-command product numbers. 

This code is designed for the creation and storage of simple numbers for a company 
to use in barcodes. 

The code requirements called for a secure site with a simple interface. User accounts were not to be used, so all access is done via a hardcoded password, kept encrypted, to allow easy access and security. 

The sequence generator uses a simple database to store numbers, and can release any number of numbers required. The user simply enters the amount requested, and hits submit. The counter then automatically updates for the next user who needs numbers.
